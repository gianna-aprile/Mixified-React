## About Mixified
***A Smart Spotify Playlist Generator***  
Mixified generates personalized playlists based on your Spotify saved tracks, top artists, and top songs. The creation process of these playlists has randomizing features to ensure you never get the same playlist twice.

## Technology Used
Mixified React Repo: https://github.com/gianna-aprile/Mixified-React  
Mixified API/Backend Repo: https://github.com/gianna-aprile/Mixified-Flask

Mixified is a React webapp that is optimized for viewing on both computers and smaller devices. Once a user requests to create a playlist, the React app sends the user's Spotify authorized token to the Python Flask app through the Mixified API. The backend then performs carefully thought out algorithms that curate a smart, personalized playlist for the user, ensuring that the same playlist never gets created twice.
